# Puzzle Platform
A simple co-op puzzle platform game where players must work together to complete each level.
Contains fully integrated UI/Menu system that allows users to host/join servers.

Made with C++, currently in prototype stage. Currently trying to enable online capabilities via Steam SDK.
